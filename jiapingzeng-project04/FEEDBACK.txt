FEEDBACK:

Well done!


Good testing of your implementation. Consider distinguishing the purpose of the
    different test cases with a brief description.


other comments:
When concatenating a String and any other object the object's toString() method
  is implicitly called. For primitives such as a double, a String representation
  is concatenated automatically:
  return "" + numSubscriptions
  So, you do not need to directly call Double.toString(subscriptions) method.
  
    public String toString() {
        return Double.toString(subscriptions);
    }
      
-Bita.
