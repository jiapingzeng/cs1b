FEEDBACK:

Well done in converting your implementation to a generic data structure!
    Note that the use of the iterator() method within the data structure
    itself (such as in contains() and toString() method) is unconventional.
    

-1 Incomplete implementation of class Country getNumSupscriptionsForPeriod() method,
   which should use an iterator to traverse the subscriptions. Partially accepting
   with for-each loop.
   See project description excerpt:
   "Use an iterator in the getNumSupscriptionsForPeriod() method of the Country class. 
   This method should use the iterator to traverse the list of SubscriptionYear elements."
   Next time minus three for key requirements such as this.


other comments:
   Following up on Canvas question:
   No, you do not need to implement a copy constructor in this project as we
   are using generics.
