FEEDBACK:

Excellent readable data table. An alternative is to use String.format() method 
    to bound the number of decimal positions displayed!
    
    
Good stress testing of your code. You are very close.


-0 Implementation of class CellularData getNumSubscriptionsInCountryForPeriod() is not able
   handle larger data set in a reasonable time. 
   
    I recommend creating an input file whose years are outside of 1960 and 2014.    
    For example, the input range may be for year 2000 and 3000. Then populate with
    randomly generated data.
